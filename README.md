This project solves the problem of farmers when they didn't get to known which pesticides they have to used to ensure the best results 

# About TFLearn

TFLearn can be described as a transparent and modular deep learning library created on top of the Tensorflow framework. The prime objective of TFLearn is to provide a higher-level API to Tensorflow so as to facilitate and accelerate experimentation, yet remaining fully compatible and transparent with it.

# Features
➡️TFLearn is easy to understand and is a user-friendly high-level API for building deep neural networks structure.

➡️Through built-in high compatibility of neural network layers, optimizers, regularizers, metrics, etc. it performs fast prototyping.

➡️TFLearn functions can be used independently as well since all functions are built upon tensors.

➡️With the use of powerful helper functions, any TensorFlow graph can be trained easily that accepts multiple inputs, outputs, and optimizers, etc.

➡️TFLearn can also be used to create magnificent graph visualizations with details about gradients, weights, activations, etc. effortlessly.

➡️Easy device placement for utilizing multiple CPU/GPU.

`Run all cell `

`wait till model load `


`last cell run and your chatbot is ready`


## Dependency 


```bash
  !pip install tflearn
```
 

```bash
  !pip install json
```


```bash
  !pip install nltk
```

## Lessons Learned
Actually I have used colab because tensorflow to install locally takes a lot of time of so to avoid that I moved to collab is just similar to juypter notebook and here tensorflow is install so no need to install.
And easy to install dependency without creating vitual environment.
